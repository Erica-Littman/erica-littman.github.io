      Junior Specialist at the Leal Laboratory of The University of California Davis, researching insect olfaction.

      - Develop and test novel molecular constructs and perform genetic cloning to evaluate the molecular and biochemical basis of insect olfaction.

      - Analyze insect phenotypes and reactions when exposed to repellents such as DEET and Î³-Octolactone to develop sustainable pesticides.

      - Clone odorant, ionotropic, and gustatory receptors. 

      - Manage and maintain large colonies of mosquitos. 

      - Perform gene silencing and genetic knockout experiments.

      Research Assistant at the Hartmann Laboratory of Northwestern University, researching antibiotic resistance.

      - Evaluate the various factors involved in multi-drug resistant strains of Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, P. fluorescence, and P. fulva via transposon mutagenesis and gene deletion to characterize the mexAB-oprM operon and its homologs.

      - Identify homologous genes across strains of Pseudomonas conferring antibiotic resistance. 

      - Conduct gDNA extractions for whole genome sequencing.

      - Add information to and edit Wikipedia pages.  

      - Synthesize data into organized technical reports for posters and later publications.
