avatar: images/avatar.jpg
bio: I post about my experience with invisible illness, examples of my 
     personal and professional writing projects, 
     and of course my cat Bubbles. I am currently looking to 
     increasingly shift my professional focus towards writing and communications, 
     and am especially interested in positions that value mentor-mentee style
     relationships and on-the job learning.
