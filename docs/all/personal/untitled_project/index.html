<h2 id="prologue--year-1857-">Prologue [ Year: 1857 ]</h2>
<p>The small homestead sat atop the five-hundred-acre ranch at the heart of the American west, the decaying wooden doors of which were complemented nicely by the surrounding mesa while the ashen roof disappeared into the massive forest behind the property; with a skeletal appearance, the branches reached for the structure.  Rusted metallic panels, as if bleeding into the fallen leaves that scattered the ground, covered the foundation. Somewhere beneath the floorboards, cockroaches feasted on the decaying foliage, finding comfort in the damp darkness. The road leading to the front of the homestead was winding and long and had been undisturbed by the footfalls of travelers for nearly 25 years: the prints long disappeared by the seasons. It cut through the vast woods that blanketed the ecosystem, the only interruption in the dense thicket. A wide white porch wrapped around the homestead, sitting under the shade of a pergola; the wooden supports bent inward, threatening to collapse. A violent breeze passed between the cracks in the walls, whistling through abandoned rooms and brushing the accumulations of dust from their home on the counters and furniture. The particles seemed to dance in the rays of light that penetrated through the shudders before disappearing as the wind died. The wooden swing swayed stilly, calling for someone; come, sit for a spell.</p>
<p>As if washing away the past two decades, the wind picked up again, shaking dust from curtains, pushing chairs back into place at the kitchen table. Closing some doors. Opening others. In the modest master bedroom, deflated pillows were refreshed as if newly fluffed; the wrinkled sheets were pulled tightly over the corners of the mattress. The creaky bunkbeds in the kid’s room were turned down and smoothed out, erasing the past depressions in the comforters. Despite the now still breeze, dust lifted from the mirrors and swept the footprints from the kitchen floor; even the yellowing paint on the walls seemed to freshen as the ranch stilled once more, appearing untouched since last abandoned.</p>
<p>The late autumn atmosphere hung heavily on the homestead as the ranch prepared to welcome the newcomers. Far ahead, the clip clopping of horses’ hooves echoed on the dusty red road. The forest began to change. Began to darken. The canopy before them was vibrantly green against the deep blue sky. A man, next to his wife, sat seemingly frozen in a covered wagon guided two horses with the reins, letting the leather bounce in his loosely closed fist. They listened to the birds chirping ahead of them and watched the leaves rustle lightly in the breeze. The serenity of the forest comforted the woman as they headed to their new land. A deer stood grazing at the tree line ahead but darted away as it looked beyond the family.</p>
<p>The three children, who sat with their feet dangling off the back of the wagon, watched the scenery begin to change behind them; as they moved, the vibrant greens were darkened and muted as storm clouds gathered and followed slowly. Rotting roots sprung from the ground in the depressions of the hoof prints, like vines, they grew towards the wheels as they rolled forward. The family’s shepherd awoke next to the children as the forest blackened and began to bark. Shadows moved unnaturally between the trees, accompanied by low, guttural growls and a violent shaking amongst the leaves. The two horses grew hesitant as the noises swelled and the clouds blanketed the sky ahead of them, darkening their path to the homestead, which came into view as the first bolt of lightning struck a tree not ten feet away from the family. As flames licked their way up the bark, the horses kicked and reared until the wagon detached. They sprinted away from the burning tree, back into the forest.</p>
<p>The man with the reins yelped and clutched his rope burned hands before shouting at the horses and taking off after them. The rest of the family spilled out of the turned over wagon and scrambled away from the growing flames.</p>
<p>“Wait!” The mother called as the first drop of rain fell gently on her head before the downpour began.</p>
<p>The shepherd, spooked by the dramatic change in weather, turned tail and ran for the nearest shelter: the homestead. 
“NO! Stop running!” Screeched the youngest child before sprinting after his beloved dog. 
“Get inside, I’ll find your father and the horses,” The mother’s voice was dwarfed by the storm as she ran into the forest.</p>
<p>He crashed through the foliage, following hoofprints in the mud, blinded by the pellets of water ambushing him. His pace slowed to an urgent walk, as the man stumbled over exposed roots and sliced his arms on thorns that protruded from the low hanging branches. His breath, bated and quick, hitched in his throat as he approached a small clearing; a perfect circle of undisturbed grass surrounded by ten, thick, towering trees. The upper branches extended over the middle of the clearing, intertwined with, and reaching for, one another; rain fell lightly on the vibrant grass. The green was contrasted starkly with the deep-red blood pouring from the horses’ necks as their decapitated heads laid face to face on display for the man to see from the entrance to the clearing. The animal’s bodies had vanished save for a thick bloody trail showing where they may have been dragged. A trail that led deeper into the forest. A trail that would disappear soon with the rain. Compelled, he followed it, leaving a trail of his own bloody footsteps. Footsteps that his wife would soon follow. Footsteps that would also disappear soon with rain.</p>
<p>“Why are you just standing there? Get inside!” She shouted to her younger brother who was standing on the porch under the shelter of the sturdy pergola.</p>
<p>“He won’t go inside! Or even up the stairs!” The toddler replied, pointing to the dog still cowering in the rain, barking at the porch steps. But, as a bolt of lightning scorched the Earth three feet behind the shepherd, the dog’s fear of the homestead was dwarfed by that of the storm and he ran to join the family as they sheltered.</p>
<p>A vicious wind, beginning at the east end of the forest, and picking up speed as it moved west towards the homestead, rushed the frightened young woman who was trying to shield her brothers who screamed as the front door blew open. They watched, silently, as the storm intensified over the forest. The sky turned to a sickly green as the funnel began to form. First on the ground, when the wind whipped up the foliage, which swirled and twirled in the cloud, and second in the sky, as if the bottom of a storm cloud were pinched and dragged down by some invisible force; the two ends reached for each other and connected. A second funnel appeared, followed by a third, and the tornadoes swam around the forest, felling trees and ripping old roots from the dirt.</p>
<p>They stood, stunned, waiting for their parents to run out from the tree line. But the only life to break through the thicket was the pack of wolves. Running wildly and urgently, they fled the storm, stampeding past the homestead towards the north end of the ranch. The oldest of the pack limped out behind the rest, pausing to stare at the young woman. Their eye contact was broken only by the sound of a tornado crashing towards them with the ferocity of a train. Unpanicked, the wolf bound away as the funnel spun in place, the widest parts of which were no more than fifteen feet from the porch steps, before it slowly dissipated, and the sky cleared.</p>
