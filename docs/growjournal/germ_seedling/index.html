<p>The first couple weeks of a cannabis plant’s life are by far the most perilous. From seed to seedling, your young plant requires plenty of TLC to keep it healthy and happy—a strong seedling gives your plant a better shot at surviving and thriving later on in its life. I started my current grow on February 25th, 2021, germinating three feminized OG Kush seeds for a deep-water culture (DWC) hydroponics system; this is my journal of the first few weeks of my grow and all the tips and tricks I used to produce the healthiest seedlings!</p>
<h3 id="germination-the-paper-towel-method-1-10-days"><em>Germination: The Paper Towel Method (1-10 Days)</em></h3>
<p>During the germination phase, the seed will break open and a small, singular white root—known as a taproot—begins to show. Tried, true, and inexpensive, you can’t go wrong with the aptly named “paper-towel method”, which is what I used to start my feminized OG Kush seeds. Some growers will swear by special gemination chambers &amp; heating mats, but the most important things that a cannabis seed needs to sprout is darkness &amp; humidity.</p>
<p>In this grow, I used a regular ceramic kitchen plate, two paper towels, and a brownie tin—but any household items than can replicate a similar set up will do! These were the steps I took to get my seeds to sprout:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Creating the humidity from the paper towels</strong>: After layering the two paper towels on top of each other on the plate, I soaked them in regular tap water and then drained any excess water. The towels should be wet, but not dripping; when you press down only a little bit of water should leak out, you don’t want to drown the seeds!</li>
<li><strong>Adding the seeds</strong>: Then I added three of my feminized OG Kush seeds on top of the paper towel and fold the two ends over the top of seeds; this will make sure the seeds are surrounded by moisture/humidity on all sides.</li>
<li><strong>Making a dark chamber</strong>: This is relatively easy—just add a cover over the paper towel to seal the seed-towel complex in darkness. Here, I used a brownie tin because I felt that add another plate on top might not leave enough air for the seeds; they don’t need much, but I think that the paper towel is a great simulation of the damp soil the seeds need to sprout, and the space of the brownie pan gives it the airy quality of growing in an open area (which cannabis plants love!). Another solution is to put the plate inside a drawer that you usually keep closed, or really anything that keeps the seeds in the dark!</li>
<li><strong>Watch for taproots</strong>: Seeds can take anywhere from between 1-10 days to start to show a taproot. In the seeds shown here, the taproot began to poke from underneath the shell at 1 days. Once the root was visible, I transferred the seed to its rapid rooter cube—you can wait until the taproot is longer than I did, but make sure you put it in its next grow container (in my case, a rapid rooter cube in a DWC set up with clay hydro pellets) before it is ¼ inch long! At that point, you’ll want the root to be able to find it’s main water source so it can start to establish a robust root system and push the shell upwards out of the cube!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="seedling-care-transplanting-seeds----first-set-of-fan-leaves-1-3-weeks"><em>Seedling Care (Transplanting Seeds &ndash; First Set of Fan Leaves; 1-3 Weeks)</em></h3>
<h4 id="week-one"><em>Week One</em></h4>
<p>After each of the three seeds began to show taproots (which happened at different days, the first on February 28th, the second on March 4th) I added the seed to a rapid rooter starting cube and placed the cube in the DWC basket surrounded by hydroton clay pellets with an 18hr/6hr photoperiod, a temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit, and a relative humidity of 80%. As the roots haven’t reached the reservoir yet, the plant is absorbing most of the moisture through the cotyledons via humidity—so it needs to be high. The roots will grow in the direction of gravity and water, so it is important to put the seeds in the cubes with the taproot facing the reservoir. As the stem grows, it will push the seed coating in the direction of the light.</p>
<p>The third seed did not sprout—which is okay! I only have room for 2 plants in my tent, but I always germinate more seeds than necessary to ensure that at least two seeds are viable.</p>
<p>By March 6th, 2021, the younger seedling begin to push through the soil of the rapid rooter. And, by March 7th, its cotyledons began to show while the older seedling was already showing its first set of true leaves—and its roots began to breach the basket and pellets!</p>
<p>The cotyledons are not considered true leaves—which are the typical fan leaves we all think of when we think of a cannabis plant—they are there to supply your plant with nutrients until it has grown a robust enough root system to extract enough nutrients from the reservoir. Because of this, it is important to wait until these leaves begin to be overshadowed by the “true leaves” to add your nutrients—too much too soon will cause nutrient burn.</p>
<p>Once the first roots were past the boundaries of the bucket and are growing towards the reservoir, I added 10 mL of hydro-guard solution: a probiotic solution that prevents root rot by adding beneficial bacteria that out-compete harmful microorganisms for available nutrients.</p>
<p>During this phase, I keep the water level higher than I do for the rest of the grow—the roots are not that long yet, so the higher water ensures they stay wet (when I add my first round of nutrients, I lower the water level!). Because of this, the reservoir volume is closer to 5 liters, and the hydro guard feeding guide recommends 2 mL of solution per liter… giving the 10 mL that I added to each system.</p>
<p>After adding anything to the reservoir, I check the pH to make sure that it stays between 5.5-6.5—the optimal pH for nutrient uptake.</p>
<h4 id="week-two-temperature-75-degrees-68-relative-humidity"><em>Week Two (Temperature: 75 Degrees, 68% Relative Humidity)</em></h4>
<p>By March 10th, the cotyledons of both plants were being covered by the true leaves and root system had reached the reservoir and started to expand outward. Time to add the nutrients and lower the reservoir volume to 3 liters! It is important to ensure that the water level is not too high during this phase, the roots need a pace for oxygen.</p>
<p>I use the general hydroponics micro-grow-bloom trio, and us this handy calculator to figure out how much I should add. With a 3-liter reservoir during the seedling stage, it recommends adding 3.7 mL of each nutrient—which I did for the older plant! The younger plant, however, I gave around 3.4-3.5 mL of each nutrient to avoid nutrient burn until it has grown more fan leaves.</p>
<p>I began measuring the ppm at this point. In the seedling stage, the recommended ppm is between 400 &amp; 500 ppm. For the younger plant, I made sure to keep it on the lower side of this scale, adding tap water as needed. The recommended amount of nutrients from the calculator gave a value of 450 ppm for the older plant, so there were no other adjustments needed to the nutrient ratios!</p>
<p>Adding the nutrients changes the pH of the reservoir, so I made sure to readjust for a pH of 5.7. Maintaining a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 is crucial to the plant’s health; check and adjust the pH anytime you add anything to your reservoir!</p>
